# p1-lanchipham
Budget app with status reminders alerting users when they are nearing their budget limit or have reached/exceeded the budget limit.

# Proposal 
The Budget Reminder is an app where users can lay out a budget, track their expenses, and set up reminders when they are close to reaching their limit for a budget category. The theme will be "Status Notifiers for Keeping a Budget". For example, if someone sets a limit of $100 for entertainment monthly, but theyâ€™ve already spent $90 before the month is up, then the app will update their budget status to notify them that they have almost reached their budget limit. 

# Users will be able to
1) Create a category
2) Delete a category
3) Set up budget limits for each category.
4) Set up alert amounts for when they are about to reach a budget limit.
5) Enter in their current use for each category.
6) View status reminders for how close they are to their budget limit.
