Budget app with gentle reminders to stay in budget

# Proposal 
The Budget Reminder is an app where users can lay out a budget, track their expenses, and set up reminders when they are close to reaching their limit for a budget category. The theme will be Gentle Reminders for Keeping a Budget. For example, if someone sets a limit of $100 for entertainment monthly, but they’ve already spent $90 before the month is up, then the app will send them a message notifying them that they have almost reached their budget limit. If they want to overspend for one category, then the app will prompt them to decrease the budget limit from another category (excluding non-negotiable categories like housing). This will remind users that overspending in one category means that another category will be impacted. 

# Users will be able to
1)	Enter in their monthly income
2)	Set up fixed monthly expenses such as housing or savings.
3)	Set up budget limits for discretionary categories such as entertainment or personal care.
4)	Set up reminders for when they are about to reach a budget limit.
5)	“Borrow” from a discretionary category if they want to overspend their budget in another category.
